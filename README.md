desert → dessert  
sir → okyaku-sama  
this guy → this person  
Yuuko → Yuukochi

Various typos.
<hr>
<b>Why?</b>  

Tunomon is incorrect. It's ツノモン (tsunomon) not テュノモン (tyunomon)     
Kyuubimon → The 'uu' matters in Japanese.   
Gerbemon → It's Ga-bo-mon in Japanese so I think this is an oversight   
Pyokomon → No 'C' in Japanese   
Huckmon → Hackmon is an Appmon and it's Hakkumon otherwise. Huck makes no sense.   
Bubbmon → Babumon. This is because 'babu' is also a pun. "Ba-bburu" being bubble (the bubbles coming off of it) and 'babu' being a sound babies make, thus the pacifier   
Goblimon → It's meant to be Gobli as in Goblin.  
Scamon → Sca, short for 'scat' and not the type of music either  
Tuchidarumon → Same reason as Tsunomon. 'Tu' is wrong.  
Tyumon, KaratukiNumemon → see above. Chuu like the sound a mouse makes.  
Hisyaryudramon → Hisharyudramon is more correct.  

Their Unresponsive → This text gets repeated for everyone in that sector male of female. Might change it as there were 3 entries.  
Basement dweller → This game is steeped in otaku language, thus 'hikikomori'  
sir → okyaku-sama, there is no gender neutral form of 'sir' so I moved it to okyaku-sama to make it gender neutral  
this guy → this person, to make it gender neutral when referncing the protag.  
Yuukochi → Before this, Nokia ia making nicknames for Yuuko and it was left, save this one.  
Rebellions → Nokia usually uses the wrong English when speaking thus Rebellions and not Rebels.  
Administrator-san → San doesn't specify gender so assigning Mr. is incorrect. Same with Navit-san.  
Rerorero World → Rerorero is the sound made licking something... it's also a Jojo reference so I put it back in.  
Bumblemon → The original was Barbar-chan which is both a cutesy nickname and a diminutive thus an insult. Bumblemon might be an actual Digimon (eventually)  
Super-Duper Demon Lord → 大 Dai Big Demon King. He's being silly with the amount of 'dai' he's using so I added it back in as a series of translation.  
<hr>
<b>Other</b>  

There was a part in the Jimiken storyline that was ommited in English. The Korean however has the two extra bands that she mentions and were added.  

THere might be other stuff I changed and fixed that wasn't noted. Sometimes I do stuff in a big batch as I play.  
<hr>
<b>What to do with this?</b> 

Unzip and move to DSDBS/text and DSDBS/message directory that's in CONTENT of the Undub. Overwrite.
