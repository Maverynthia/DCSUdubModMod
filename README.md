<b>Digimon Cyber Sleuth - The Undub Mod... Mod

A Mod of the current "The Undub Mod 1.1" that further fixes Digimon names and Digiline question/s</b>

Changed:
Tunomon → Tsunomon  
Kyubimon → Kyuubimon  
Gerbemon → Garbemon  
Pyocomon → Pyokomon  
Huckmon → Hakkumon (and all veriants)  
Bubbmon → Babumon  
Goburimon → Goblimon  
Scumon → Scamon  
Tuchidarumon → Tsuchidarumon  

Corrected the Devimon Digiline question:  
Mind controlled → Mind controlling  

Corrected some typos in messages:  
She's Unresponsive → Their Unresponsive  
animus → anime  
waifus → anime wives  
huger → hunger  
basement dweller → hikikomori  
<hr>
<b>Why?</b>  

Tunomon is incorrect. It's ツノモン (tsunomon) not テュノモン (tyunomon)     
Kyuubimon → The 'uu' matters in Japanese.   
Gerbemon → It's Ga-bo-mon in Japanese so I think this is an oversight   
Pyokomon → No 'C' in Japanese   
Huckmon → Hackmon is an Appmon and it's Hakkumon otherwise. Huck makes no sense.   
Bubbmon → Babumon. This is because 'babu' is also a pun. "Ba-bburu" being bubble (the bubbles coming off of it) and 'babu' being a sound babies make, thus the pacifier   
Goblimon → It's meant to be Gobli as in Goblin.  
Scamon → Sca, short for 'scat' and not the type of music either  
Tuchidarumon → Same reason as Tsunomon. 'Tu' is wrong.  

Their Unresponsive → This text gets repeated for everyone in that sector male of female. Might change it as there were 3 entries.  
Basement dweller → This game is steeped in otaku language, thus 'hikikomori'  
<hr>
<b>Other</b>  
There was a part in the Jimiken storyline that was ommited in English. The Korean however has the two extra bands that she mentions and were added.  
<hr>
<b>What to do with this?</b> 

Unzip and move to DSDBS/text and DSDBS/message directory that's in CONTENT of the Undub. Overwrite.
