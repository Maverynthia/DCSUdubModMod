<b>Digimon Cyber Sleuth - The Undub Mod... Mod

A Mod of the current "The Undub Mod 1.1" that further fixes Digimon names and Digiline question/s</b>

Changed:
Tunomon → Tsunomon  
Kyubimon → Kyuubimon  
Gerbemon → Garbemon  
Pyocomon → Pyokomon  
Huckmon → Hakkumon (and all veriants)  
Bubbmon → Babumon  
Goburimon → Goblimon

Corrected the Devimon Digiline question:  
Mind controlled → Mind controlling  
<hr>
<b>Why?</b>  

Tunomon is incorrect. It's ツノモン (tsunomon) not テュノモン (tyunomon)     
Kyuubimon → The 'uu' matters in Japanese.   
Gerbemon → It's Ga-bo-mon in Japanese so I think this is an oversight   
Pyokomon → No 'C' in Japanese   
Huckmon → Hackmon is an Appmon and it's Hakkumon otherwise. Huck makes no sense.   
Bubbmon → Babumon. This is because 'babu' is also a pun. "Ba-bburu" being bubble (the bubbles coming off of it) and 'babu' being a sound babies make, thus the pacifier   
Goblimon → It's meant to be Gobli as in Goblin.
<hr>
<b>What to do with this?</b> 

Unzip and move the /text directory into the CONTENT directory of the Undub. Overwrite.
